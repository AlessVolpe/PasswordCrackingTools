# PasswordCrackingTools

A collection of script that I made while learning password cracking. Those tools are just for learning and used to complete an old university project of mine, don't use them for evil.

## Password Mask Analyzer

A simple tool to analize word list mask distribution.

### Usage

```bash
python Main.py --top=length_of_top_list wordlist_filename
```

It requires click to work and it can be installed by simply typing:

```bash
pip install click
```
